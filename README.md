# Node-Blog

This is a project to create a minimal blog using node.js, express, and mongodb.

The inspiration and instruction is all from [howtonode.org](http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb)

My goal is to use to project to help my limited understanding of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [mongodb](http://mongodb.org), and to add on to the project, once I'm comfortable with node and mongo.
